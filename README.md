PredictitÃ©acs text prediction final year project exploring possible text prediction techniques that can be used as a resource for the Irish language. Resources used are the four files ci.sweep.consumers.latin1.txt, kevscan.clean.txt, paradocs.clean.txt & europe.clean.txt corpus of Irish text. Using these files included the project explores

1. Taking in the data using a Scanner
2. Splitting the data up into word tokens 
3. Calculating unique word frequency counts using for comparison using Hashmap,treemap and arraylist data structures so that the highest frequency word value may be returned to the user as prediction
4. Storing these words and their frequency counts in text files (can be done in command prompt using java filename > outputfilename.txt)
5. Taking in these values using text files to an android application 
6. Using algorithms to loop through text input by user and match against substrings of the Irish data words as entered in arrays storing resulting matches in an array and comparing matches frequency counts so that the highest may be output back to the user
7. Creating android features such as edittexts for text input, toasts for popup explanations to user, textviews for text prediction output and also hints to tell the user what to do, error warnings and button click and event listeners to carry out activities on these user actions.
